        Ramp/Smart Installation

Ramp is built on top of an AMP (Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and the
Zend Framework.

AMP:
----
These installation instructions assume that you have a working AMP
implementation, which may come bundled with your operating system,
may be created by downloading and installing the Apache, MySQL, and
PHP components separately, or may be downloaded as a bundled,
integrated unit (for example, MAMP, LAMP, XAMPP, or WAMP). If you
do not have one of these, see the following websites for installation
and tutorials:

    XAMPP: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html
        Works with Mac, Windows & Linux
    MAMP: http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html
        Works with Mac
    WAMP: http://www.wampserver.com/en/
        Works with Windows
    LAMP: *****
        Works with Linux
    MySQL:  http://www.mysql.com/
    PHP:  http://www.php.net/


Zend Framework:
---------------
Ramp was developed using Zend Framework 1.11, but has also been
tested under Zend Framework 1.12.  NOTE: Ramp has not yet been
ported to Zend Framework 2, which is a complete redesign of the
framework.  To download Zend 1.12, see
    http://www.zend.com/community/downloads


Getting Started with Ramp:
--------------------------
Once you have a server and a database, you must download the most
recent version of RAMP from https://github.com/AlyceBrady/ramp.

Since Ramp uses the Zend Framework, copy or link the Zend Framework
library to the library subdirectory within Ramp.  For example, if
.../ZendFrameworkLoc refers to where your ZendFramework is installed
and .../RampLoc refers to where RAMP is installed, then do the
following:
    cd .../RampLoc/library
    ln -s .../ZendFrameworkLoc/library/Zend Zend

Ramp expects to find a file called application.ini in the
.../RampLoc/application/configs/ directory.  This file would normally
contain Ramp configuration information, some of which may have to
be customized for your environment.  To prevent the possibility
that local customizations in an application.ini file might be
overwritten by future Ramp updates, the Ramp download contains two
files called smartApplicationTemplate.ini (for Smart application
installations) and rampApplicationTemplate.ini (for any other use
of Ramp) instead of providing application.ini.  For an initial
installation, create a copy of whichever of the template files is
more appropriate, call it application.ini, and edit it as appropriate.
(Some modifications will arise in setting up the Ramp database, as
explained in the next section.)  When installing a Ramp update, you
will need to compare your application.ini file against the new
applicationTemplate.ini file, incorporating new changes as appropriate.

Setting up the Ramp Database:
-----------------------------
See the INSTALL_DB.txt file, which includes instructions on setting
up MySQL accounts, protecting the account passwords, and setting
up initial databases & tables.

Setting up Ramp on Your Server:
-------------------------------
[The following section is still under construction...]

… [Write instructions for setting up vhosts.] … See the vhostExamples.conf
file in the installation directory for examples on setting up virtual
hosts on your machine for the demonstration and development/production
databases.  If the server is being used on the local machine, you need
to edit /etc/hosts and add lines that resolve the virtual server
names from vhosts to the local machine.  For example,
    127.0.0.1       ramp.development
If the server should be accessible to a limited, pre-defined set
of machines, edit /etc/hosts files on those machines to resolve the
virtual hostnames to the machine servicing Ramp.  If Ramp should
be visible beyond that, you probably need to register the server name.
(If can’t, or don’t want to, get vhosts to work, may be able to get
same results with .htaccess.  Uncomment the last line and specify
the correct APPLICATION_ENV (production, development, testing,
rampdemo, smartdemo, etc.).  Without vhosts, though, it’s not quite
as easy to have different environments running on one server.)
