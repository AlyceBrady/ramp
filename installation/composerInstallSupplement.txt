to resolve dependencies with Zend and Twitter Bootstrap:

install Composer:

    *nix:
    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

    Windows:
    https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe

then run it
    *nix:
    cd /path/to/ramp/
    php composer.phar install

Alyce:
This didn't fully work.  See below for details.

Back to Ashton:

    Windows:
    cd /path/to/ramp/
    composer install

This will give you a bunch of things in a folder named ext-libs. To link them so that RAMP will be able to use the resources, either link or copy:

ext-libs/bonndan/twitter-bootstrap-zf1/lib/TwitterBootstrap to library/TwitterBootstrap
ext-libs/simukti/zf1/Zend to library/Zend
twitter-bootstrap/docs/assets to public/tb_assets

Alyce:
This didn't fully work.  It did get me an ext-libs directory, and I was
able to get ext-libs/twitter-bootstrap/docs/assets from there.  Then I went to
https://github.com/andreaswarnaar/twitter-bootstrap-zf1 and downloaded
the zip file.  I was able to get
twitter-bootstrap/twitter-bootstrap-zf1-master/lib/TwitterBootstrap from
there.  I did not copy ext-libs/simukti/zf1/Zend to library/Zend since I
already had a library/Zend.
