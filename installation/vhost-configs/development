#
# Virtual Host Example for Ramp/Smart
# 
# In the example below, the DocumentRoot for the Ramp or Smart
# environment should be the appropriate ".../ramp/public" directory under
# either the server's overall DocumentRoot directory
# (/var/www in the example below) or a developer's or adminstrator's
# personal DocumentRoot directory (e.g., /home/username/www).  The
# ErrorLog and CustomLog can be in system space, as in the example below,
# or in Ramp's space if you create a directory such as ".../ramp/log".
#
# You can name your server whatever seems appropriate for your context;
# the example below illustrates running the Ramp Demo in a university setting.
# The APPLICATION_ENV variable for each server should match the name
# of a section in your application/configs/application.ini file.  For
# example, the rampdemo APPLICATION_ENV for a Ramp Demo server would
# match the rampdemo section in the rampDemo.ini file in the
# application/configs directory, while a smart_production APPLICATION_ENV
# would match the smart_production section in the
# smartApplicationTemplate.ini file.  If you do not set an
# APPLICATION_ENV variable, its value will default to 'production'.
