        RAMP/SMART Database Installation Instructions
        ---------------------------------------------

This file contains installation instructions for setting up MySQL accounts
and demonstration, development, test, and production databases for Ramp
(Record and Activity Management Program) and Smart (Software for Managing
Academic Records and Transcripts).

Getting Ready:
--------------

The installation instructions in this file refer to two SQL script
files, createRampDatabases.sql (for both Ramp and Smart) and
createSmartDatabases.sql (Smart only), to be edited and run.  To
prevent the possibility that local customizations in these files
might be overwritten by future software updates, the initial download
contains files called createRampDatabasesTemplate.sql and
createSmartDatabasesTemplate.sql instead.  For an initial installation,
the first steps, therefore, are to:
    * Copy createRampDatabasesTemplate.sql to createRampDatabases.sql.
    * Copy createSmartDatabasesTemplate.sql to createSmartDatabases.sql.
In the instructions that follow, edit the two new files, leaving the
two original template files untouched.

To protect the security of the Ramp/Smart database, the database administrator
responsible for creating and maintaining the database must take
several steps before creating the users and databases used by Ramp.

    * First, change the permissions of the createRampDatabases.sql
      and createSmartDatabases.sql files so that they can be read
      only by the database administrator (access mode of 400 or
      600).

    * The database administrator's .mysql_history file should also be
      readable only by its owner.  

    * After those protective measures have been taken, change the
      rampdba password in the createRampDatabases.sql file to the
      actual password that will be used.  (This MySQL account is
      designed to be used by the database administrator when working
      in MySQL or phpMyAdmin directly.)  The user name may also
      be changed if desired; for example, rampdba could be changed
      to smartdba.

    * The database administrator should create a mysql option file, again
      readable only by its owner, containing the rampdba password.  This
      could be a .my.cnf file in the home directory or an options file
      somewhere else.  The file would include:
        [client]
        password=the_rampdba_password
      It might also include the user, host, or other options.

    * If the rampdba user name has been changed to something else (e.g.,
      smartdba), then update the createSmartDatabases.sql file,
      changing every occurrence of rampdba to the new user name.

    * Update the ramp/application/configs/application.ini file to
      reflect the user name and password defined in the
      createRampDatabases.sql file.

Ramp and Smart use MySQL accounts to create categories of domain users
that have different kinds of privileges on different databases.  The
user/authorization tables (still being implemented) define individual
users.

    * To set up appropriate domain user accounts and their privileges in
      the Ramp/Smart databases, uncomment and modify the domain user
      accounts in createRampDatabases.sql (and createSmartDatabses.sql
      if appropriate).

    * Update the ramp/application/configs/application.ini file to
      reflect the user accounts and passwords defined in the
      createRampDatabases.sql and createSmartDatabases.sql files.

Creating the Accounts and Databases in MySQL:
---------------------------------------------

    * Using a MySQL account that has permission to create new
      accounts and new databases, run MySQL from the terminal or
      command-line and read in the createRampDatabases.sql file
      with the source command:
          cd ramp/installation
          mysql -u root -p
          Password: *******
          mysql> source createRampDatabases.sql

      If using Smart, do the same with createSmartDatabases.sql.

    * To set up the Ramp or Smart demonstration databases, read
      ramp_demo.sql or smart_demo.sql in to MySQL, e.g.:
          mysql> source ramp_demo.sql

    * To set up a Smart development database, make a copy of
      smart_demo.sql and change the "smart_demo" references to
=>    "smart_dev".  Do the same with ramp_demo, since the testing
=>    associated with both smart_dev and smart_test uses the tables
=>    from both the ramp-demo and smart_demo databases.
=> Fix this?

    * [Under Development...]  Need to provide schema for Smart
      production database, although with no data ...
