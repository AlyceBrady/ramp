; This file specifies a subset of the fields in the "places" table
; to appear in a report.

; This setting was developed to test and demonstrate the difference
; between reports and tabular views.

; Note: the tableFootnote has two spaces at the end of the line after
; "extended example" in order to force a Markdown line-break.
