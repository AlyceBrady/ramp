; Testing Activity configuration files

; This file has:
;   - no activity list
;   - no sections
;   - consists solely of one "unattached" activity specification at the
;       top level
; As a result, RAMP should create an activity list with the name of this
; file (minus the suffix), and the list should contain a single entry for
; the one activity specification.

type = "setting"

title = "Single Activity; Creates List"
description = "Activity config file has one activity spec but no list,
so should create a list containing the one spec"
