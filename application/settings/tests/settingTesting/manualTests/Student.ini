; This file has:
;   - explicit sequence information
;   - view and add/delete use different settings
;   - all settings are defined externally

; Setting tests/settingTesting/manualTests/StudentView has:
;   - setting information for one setting only, no sequence information
;   - two table connections, both to Person table, one using an alias
;   - one table connection uses abbreviated format, one uses
;     fully-qualified format (tableConnection.Advisor.connection = ...)
;   - imported fields, some using same fieldnames and some using aliases
;   - two external table references, one using format that would allow
;     for multiple matching fields (externalTableRef.TermStanding.match1...)
