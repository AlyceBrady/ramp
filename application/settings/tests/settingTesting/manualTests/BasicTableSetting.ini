; Plain vanilla, simple, valid table setting for use in testing

; This file has:
;   - no explicit sequence information
;   - no sections
;   - a table title, description, and footnote, all different
;   - one hidden field
;   - two visible fields
;
; This file can be used as a test for when no sequence information is
; provided (system must use defaults), or as an externally defined
; table setting for sequence settings.
