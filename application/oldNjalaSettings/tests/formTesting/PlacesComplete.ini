; This file provides labels for all the fields in the "places" table,
; making all fields visible.

; This setting tests the following:
;   - all fields have labels and none are marked "hidden", so all are visible
;   - table has a table title, description, and footnote, all different
;   - visible primary key (disabled for updates)
;   - four visible required fields, one of which does auto-incrementing,
;     the other three of which have to be provided
;   - three required fields that have field footnotes (so hover in
;     record display shows both the required information and the footnote)
;   - two extraneous fields listed that do not exist in the database,
;     resulting in an error message (more of a warning, since it has no
;     effect).

;
; NOTES:
;   "places" table in database has 4 required fields:
;       - id (auto-incremented)
;       - date_created
;       - date_updated
;       - name
;   It also has 2 fields with defaults:
;       - town (default is London)
;       - country (default is UK)
;   This setting marks two additional fields as "recommended" (address1
;   and town), and provides field footnotes for three fields (name,
;   date_created, and date_updated).
