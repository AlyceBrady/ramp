RAMP needs to have an application.ini file in the application/configs
directory, but one is not provided in the RAMP repository.  Instead, one
should be built as part of the installation process.  Several files
that serve as the basic building blocks for an application.ini file are
provided in the repository:
    ramp_basics.ini     defines some very basic properties
    ramp_defaults.ini   defines default values for properties common to
                            most or all RAMP applications

    template_custom_properties.ini  a template for customizing basic and
                                        default properties

    ramp_demo.ini

To create an application.ini file for the RAMP Demo application, make a
copy of template_custom_properties.ini (called custom_properties.ini,
for example).  Edit it to customize the username and password that the
RAMP Demo will use to access the database.  Customize any other
properties as appropriate (you may need to copy them from ramp_basics or
ramp_defaults first).

Then build your application.ini from the following files:
    ramp_basics.ini
    ramp_defaults.ini
    custom_properties.ini
    ramp_demo.ini
For example, on Unix/Linux/MacOS:
    cat ramp_basics.ini ramp_defaults.ini  >application.ini
    cat custom_properties.ini ramp_demo.ini >>application.ini

To create an application.ini file for a new RAMP application, copy and
modify one of the other template files, whichever is appropriate, in
addition to copying and customizing template_custom_properties.ini.
    template_custom_properties.ini    a template for customizing basic and
                                          default properties
    template_rampAppl_production.ini  a template for production and
                                          test/staging environments
    template_rampAppl_devel.ini       a template for development and
                                          regression testing environments

Then build your application.ini from the following files:
    ramp_basics.ini
    ramp_defaults.ini
    custom_properties.ini
    your application's production or development file

If you are using git and for security reasons you do not want to add and
commit files with your database passwords, you may wish to add
custom_properties.ini and application.ini to your .gitignore file.
