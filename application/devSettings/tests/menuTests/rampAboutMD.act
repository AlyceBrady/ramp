# RAMP: Record and Activity Management Program #

Ramp is a program that supports the easy creation of simple
activity files (lists of grouped activities with descriptions),
provides a mechanism for creating database views (called \"table
settings\") that is meant to be accessible to domain experts (as
opposed to database experts), and provides software for populating,
viewing, and updating database tables through the table settings.
For any database table for which a table setting has been
defined, Ramp supports:

 * A search mechanism for finding records based on values in
 fields

 * A table view for viewing a set of table records with column
 headings

 * A list view for viewing table records (often just a defined
   subset of columns, useful for selecting a single record from
   a search that yielded multiple results)

 * A single-record view for viewing records in their entirety,
   modifying them, or adding new records to the table; single-record
   views may also contain links to other, related tables or
   records if the relationships are defined in the table
   setting

Ramp is set up to work with tables defined in a MySQL database,
using the Zend Framework.
