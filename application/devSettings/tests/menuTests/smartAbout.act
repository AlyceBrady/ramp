<h1>
SMART: Software for Managing Academic Records and Transcripts
</h1>

<p>
Smart is a program for managing records needed to support an academic
institution.  It currently supports managing academic records in
three broad categories:
</p>

<ul>
     <li> Curriculum records dealing with courses of study (e.g.,
       undergraduate mathematics), courses or modules (e.g., Calculus
       I), and their individual offerings (e.g., the Spring 2012
       offering of Calculus I)</li>

     <li> Instructor records (e.g., contract start/end dates, courses or
       modules taught)</li>

     <li> Student records (e.g., courses of study, test scores, enrollment
       history)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Smart allows a database administrator to create various views of
the tables in the database, called "table settings." For any database
table for which a table setting has been defined, Smart supports:
</p>

<ul>
     <li> A search mechanism for finding records based on values in
     fields</li>

     <li> A table view for viewing a set of table records with column
     headings</li>

     <li> A list view for viewing table records (often just a defined
       subset of columns, useful for selecting a single record from
       a search that yielded multiple results)</li>

     <li> A single-record view for viewing records in their entirety,
       modifying them, or adding new records to the table; single-record
       views may also contain links to other, related tables or
       records if the relationships are defined in the table
       setting</li>
</ul>

<p>
In time, the plan is to expand Smart to include customized activities
specific to the academic records domain, such as student registration
and generation of transcripts.
</p>

<p>
Smart is built on top of Ramp (Record and Activity Management Program),
which provides generic methods for creating pages for choosing among
various activities and for viewing and updating database tables.  Ramp,
in turn, uses MySQL, PHP, and the Zend Framework.
