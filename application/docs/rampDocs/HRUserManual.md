<h1> SMART: Software for Managing Academic Records and Transcripts </h1>
<h2> HR User Manual </h2>

[ [Introduction](#intro) | ... ]

<div id="intro"></div>

Smart is a program for managing records needed to support an academic
institution.  It currently supports managing academic records in
three broad categories:

 * __Curriculum records__ dealing with courses of study (e.g.,
   undergraduate mathematics), courses or modules (e.g., Calculus
   I), and their individual offerings (e.g., the Spring 2012
   offering of Calculus I)

 * __Staff records__ (e.g., contract start/end dates, courses or
   modules taught)

 * __Student records__ (e.g., courses of study, test scores, enrollment
   history)

This document focuses on using Smart to manage staff records.
See the [Smart User Manual][suserman] for instructions on general Smart
activities, such as setting and changing your password,
navigating using activity files, accessing data records in general, and
other basic functionality.

Adding New Staff records
</h3>

One way to start entering data about staff members is to use the
Personal Data Form circulated to staff members in late 2013.  Smart
provides a set of screens that are based on this form.  Each screen
allows you to fill in the items from the form that correspond to a
particular Smart table (the Person table, the Staff table, the Job
Function table, etc.).  Not all of the relevant data can be entered from
this set of screens though; addresses, phone numbers, children, and
institutions attended are special cases because a staff member may
be associated with more than one of them.  As a result, they have
to be added to their own tables separately.

> Hint: Some people may find it easier to have five tabs open -- one for
> the Personal Data form, one for entering addresses, one for entering
> phone numbers, one for entering information about children, and one
> for entering information about qualifications or institutions attended.

From the Staff
menu or the main Staff activity page, choose Personal Data Entry.
  - First page:  On the first page, enter the staff member's personal
    information, such as name, sex, email address, NASSIT, date and
    place of birth, marital status, spouse information, and next of kin.
    (You will have to scroll down to find some of these fields.)
    Click on "Save Changes".  (You can also just hit Enter if your
    cursor is in a plain text field; this does not work, though, if the
    cursor is on a drop-down menu.)
  - At the bottom of the page, click on Addresses.  For a new staff
    member, no addresses will be found.  Click on the "Add New Entry"
    button, which will create a new address record with the new staff
    member's ID number already filled in.  Set the address type to
    Current or Permanent and then enter the appropriate address
    information.  When you are done click on "Save Changes" (or hit
    Enter).
  - The easiest way to enter a second address for the same person is to
    click on "Clone this Entry".  Change the address type and any parts
    of the address that are different from the previous address.
    #NOTE:# If the person has the same Permanent and Current Address,
    you should still create two records.  In this case, the only
    difference between them will be the Address Type.  (This will
    allow
