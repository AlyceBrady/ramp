# RAMP: Record and Activity Management Program #

Ramp is a program that supports the easy creation of simple
activity files (lists of grouped activities with descriptions),
provides a mechanism for creating database views (called "table
settings") that is meant to be accessible to domain experts (as
opposed to database experts), and provides software for populating,
viewing, and updating database tables through the table settings.

Ramp is set up to work with tables defined in a MySQL database,
using the Zend Framework.
