[VERY EARLY, VERY DRAFTY NOTES]

Describe the major activities or types of pages within Ramp:

Logging in and setting/changing your password.

Activity files provide a way of grouping or structuring related data and
activities into a sort of "home page" for that grouping.

Table screens provide a way of viewing data in a table by record or
groups, editing data, or adding or deleting data.  Specifically, the
actions are:
  - Search for a record or group of records
  - View a list of records (e.g., the results of a search, or all the
    records in a table if the table is not too big)
  - View the records in tabular format (a simple report with column
    headings)
  - View a single record
  - Edit a record
  - Delete a record
  - Add a new record
  - Add a new record by first cloning an existing, similar record
    (not including the key information that makes that record unique)

Reports are similar to tabular views, except that it is possible to
create specialized stylesheets that govern their appearance.

<h3 id="pw"> Setting and Changing Your Password </h3>

Notes:
  - New users (including DBAs when accounts first created) are given a
  default password.  This causes RAMP to redirect the user to a Set
  Password screen the first time they try to log in.

<h3 id="activities"> Understanding Menus and Activity Files </h3>

How much can be said about this?  Is most of it
application-dependent?

Say anything about procedures or workflows?

<h3 id="tables"> Accessing Data </h3>

Probably the most important activities to document are Search and Add.

<h4 id="search"> Searching </h4>

Explain how to do a search, including
the difference between Search-All and Search-Any.

<h4 id="lists"> Viewing Lists and Tables </h4>

How to choose a single record to view/edit/delete from a Search Results
page (list or tabular view). <i class='icon-remove'></i>, <i
class='icon-search'></i>

Explain the 
<i class='icon-ok'></i>, 
<i class='icon-adjust'></i>, and
<i class='icon-minus'></i> icons.

Would be nice if we had a sorting feature that we could document!

Explain the purpose and use of external references at the bottom of
single-record view pages.

<h4 id="add"> Viewing, Adding, and Editing Single Records </h4>

Will need lots of documentation on adding.

Editing may not need much, but can piggy-back on some of the explanation
under adding of things like required, recommended, and discouraged
fields, external fields, etc.

<h4 id="reports"> Generating Reports </h4>

Will this get documented here or in the Ramp Admin User Manual?
