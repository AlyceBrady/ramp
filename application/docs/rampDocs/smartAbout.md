# SMART: Software for Managing Academic Records and Transcripts #

Smart is a program for managing records needed to support an academic
institution.  It currently supports managing academic records in
three broad categories:

 * Curriculum records dealing with courses of study (e.g.,
   undergraduate mathematics), courses or modules (e.g., Calculus
   I), and their individual offerings (e.g., the Spring 2012
   offering of Calculus I)

 * Instructor records (e.g., contract start/end dates, courses or
   modules taught)

 * Student records (e.g., courses of study, test scores, enrollment
   history)

In time, the plan is to expand Smart to include customized activities
specific to the academic records domain, such as student registration
and generation of transcripts.

Smart is built on top of Ramp (Record and Activity Management Program),
which provides generic methods for creating pages for choosing among
various activities and for viewing and updating database tables.  Ramp,
in turn, uses MySQL, PHP, and the Zend Framework.
